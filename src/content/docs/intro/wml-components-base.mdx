title:  WML Components Base
description: The Windmillcode Angular CDK Library
---


When working on web applications, there is no standard baseline. The Angular WML Components Base Library establishes a foundation for your application, ensuring consistency and scalability. The core of this library is the `WMLUIProperty`, which represents the basic building block of every element in a web application. This property encapsulates all the essential features, and there are several subclasses like `WMLRoute` for routes, `WMLView` to leverage change detection, `WMLImage` for images  and `WMLAnimateUIProperty` for CSS animations. Each class has properties and methods to optimize your work in those features of  your application. You can use this package and leave out the rest of the library and you will get very far building very robust and scalable applications

## Installation

```bash
npm install -s --verbose @windmillcode/angular-wml-components-base
```

### v17.2.3001 [3/22/24]
* created WMLComponentBaseZero which shortens and hides the complex logic of
our WMLComponents

###### New Features
- Introduced `WMLComponentBaseZero`, a new base class designed to simplify and encapsulate the complex logic associated with WML components. This enhancement aims to provide a cleaner and more intuitive interface for working with WML components.

###### Enhancements in `component-base.ts`:

1. **Refactored `WMLComponentBaseZeroProps`:**
   - Transitioned from a traditional class-based approach to a mixin-based pattern using `WMLComponentBaseZeroPropsMixin`. This change is intended to enhance flexibility and reusability across different component implementations.
   - The mixin `WMLComponentBaseZeroPropsMixin` is now used to dynamically extend a base class, incorporating custom properties and methods essential for WML components.
   - Introduced a new `setState` method within the mixin, providing a streamlined way to update component state.

2. **Introduced `WMLComponentBaseZero`:**
   - This new base class leverages `WMLComponentBaseZeroProps` to offer a robust foundation for component development.
   - The constructor now initializes class and ID prefixes if they are provided, enabling more consistent and predictable styling and DOM structure.
   - Enhanced the `listenForSetState` method to work seamlessly with the new state management approach, ensuring changes are propagated efficiently and reliably.

###### Key Changes to Note:
- The `listenForSetState` method now listens to changes from `setStateSubj`, aligning with the new state management strategy.
- Destructor (`ngOnDestroy`) logic has been updated to ensure proper cleanup, reducing the risk of memory leaks and ensuring better resource management.

###### Usage:
- To leverage the new `WMLComponentBaseZero`, extend your components from this base class and utilize the provided mechanisms for state management and lifecycle handling.
- The mixin approach offers enhanced customization, allowing developers to inject additional properties or methods as needed.

###### Recommendations:
- Review the updated implementation details in `WMLComponentBaseZero` and `WMLComponentBaseZeroPropsMixin` to fully understand the new component structure and behavior.
- Test your components thoroughly to ensure compatibility with the new base class and to leverage the improvements in state management and lifecycle handling.

This update signifies our commitment to improving the developer experience and streamlining component development within the WML ecosystem.

### v17.2.3001 [3/2/24]
 * updated package to conform with @windmillcode/angular-wml-components-base

### v17.2.3002 [3/5/24]
* [UPDATE] Added a new `fields` array of type `Array<{value:any}>` to the `WMLAPIPaginationRequestModel` class in `data-source-utils.ts`. This new field is designed to hold additional data fields that may be required during pagination requests.

* [PATCH] Modified the `animationEnd` method in the `WMLAnimateUIProperty` class within `models.ts`. The condition now removes any spaces from `this.animationClass` before checking its presence in the event target's className. This ensures the animation end logic accurately identifies the target regardless of space characters in the class name.

 * updated package to reflect the version  ^17.2.4 of @angular/core package

### v17.2.4002 [3/12/24]
* [PATCH] In `wml-components-base/src/lib/component-base.ts`, added a new `ReplaySubject` called `setStateEvent`, which enhances state management within the component. Also adjusted the RxJS pipe in the `setState` method to include an additional operation that emits the updated state to `setStateEvent`, improving the reactivity of the component state.

* [UPDATE] ensure dervied class passed type to base classes
Updated models.ts by add the WMLConstructorDecorator function, to streamline and optimize object initialization practices within the framework.

```ts
  constructor(props:Partial<T>={}){
    let origProps = Object.entries(props).filter(([key, val]) => {
      return !key.startsWith('param');
    });
    Object.assign(this, { ...Object.fromEntries(origProps) });
  }

to use
```ts
@WMLConstructorDecorator
export class T {
  constructor(props: Partial<T> = {}) { }
}
