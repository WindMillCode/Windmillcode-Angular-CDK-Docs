Welcome to the Windmillcode Angular Library, a comprehensive suite of Angular components designed to help you build engaging, robust, and user-friendly web applications. This library, also known as the Windmillcode Angular Component Development Kit (CDK), provides a collection of reusable UI components, each crafted with attention to detail and performance.

The project is still in beta because we want to make fundamental changes to our component library concerning animation, conformity, and accessing fuctionality w/o the need of a component for greater customization refer below to which packages you can use in production.

## Roadmap
- [x] Library Conformity
- [ ] Leverage WMLAnimateUIProperty to increase the ease and capabilities of animation
- [x] Components with Functionality in Props
- [x] Backport current version to all previous angular versions


## Features

### Feels Like React
- You have a component and you have your props and you also have setState. This design makes it easier for those with a React/Nextjs background to transition to Angular if using our library

### Plug And Play
Angular can get rather a verbose language we aim to simplify angular with plug and play mentaility
With plug and play every compoonent has its props as in react
this props is a class and you simply pass the prop the to class to render the component
```ts
// app.component.ts

// Standalone there are default values to see how the component works
props = new WMLInputZeroProps({})

// To pass arguments/customize
props = new WMLInputZeroProps({
  datetime:new WMLInputZeroDatetimeProps({
    type:"datetime",
    min =new Date("[YOUR BIRTHDAY FOR EXAMPLE]")
  })
})
```

```html
// app.component.html
<wml-input [props]=props>
</wml-input>
```


### Constant and conforming updates :
- Since around Angular 16.2 for every angular version  we create a new version of the library. The versions are based on @angular-core  This means that you can be sure that the library is always up to date with the latest angular version. down to the patch version. However as of 18.1.3 the library has been unified for production use


### Extensive Component Collection
 Our library includes a wide array of components, ranging from UI elements like buttons and input fields to complex constructs like file upload and dropdowns. Each component is designed to be modular, making it easy to integrate into your existing Angular projects.


### Customizable and Themable
 Components are designed to be easily customizable and themable, allowing you to align them with your application's branding and design guidelines.Via modifying the css variables specific to each component you can get granular control over the look and feel of the components.

{/* <!-- - **Test Ready**: Each component comes with its own set of unit tests, ensuring that they work as expected and providing a foundation for you to add your own tests as you integrate them into your projects. --> */}

### PREMIUM
**Internationalization** - All components are i18n compatible under ngx-translate. Use the default en.json file in your project and update and pass the i18n strings to the appropriate keys in the props that are passed to the component
